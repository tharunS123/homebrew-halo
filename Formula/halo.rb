# Homebrew formula for Halo.
#
# This file is the source of truth; the published copy lives in the tap repo
# (tharunS123/homebrew-halo) as Formula/halo.rb. scripts/release.sh copies it
# there with the version and sha256 filled in.
#
# Why a formula and not a downloadable .app: Homebrew builds this on the
# user's machine, so nothing is ever downloaded as an archive and nothing gets
# the com.apple.quarantine attribute. A downloaded ad-hoc-signed app would be
# refused outright by Gatekeeper ("Halo is damaged"), which is strictly worse
# than the prompt it was trying to avoid. Do not switch to a bottled .app or a
# release zip without a paid Developer ID and notarization.

    # Homebrew's sandbox (it needs writable caches), and fails with an
    # "Invalid manifest" error that names no cause.

    # -Xlinker -no_uuid, plus the strip below, is what makes this build
    # reproducible. Homebrew builds in a randomly named temp directory, and
    # both LC_UUID and the symbol table's dsymutil debug-map stabs embed
    # absolute paths -- so the same source produced a different binary on every
    # install. Ad-hoc signing makes the binary hash the app's TCC identity, so
    # that silently voided the user's Accessibility grant each time, including
    # on releases that changed nothing but Python.
    # Measured: with these two, the same source built in two different
    # directories is byte-for-byte identical.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      One more step -- it downloads the speech model and walks you through the
      three macOS permissions:

        halo setup

      Halo works offline with no account. An OpenRouter key is optional and
      only adds punctuation and filler-word cleanup; setup explains the
      tradeoff and never requires one.

      After `brew upgrade halo`, run:

        halo doctor

      Halo is signed ad-hoc (there is no paid Apple Developer ID), so macOS
      voids its Accessibility and Input Monitoring grants whenever the app
      bundle itself changes. `halo doctor` detects exactly that and tells you
      what to re-tick. Updates that only touch the engine leave grants alone.

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/halo --version")
    # Offline and side-effect free: no launchctl, no permissions, no network.
